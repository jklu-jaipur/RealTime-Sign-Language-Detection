# RealTime-Sign-Language-Detection
This project mainly focuses on bridging the gap using artificial intelligence
(AI) to facilitate better communication between DHH and non-signing
hearing people by providing automatic real-time sign language translation.
This is an end to end deep learning project in which we used transfer learning.
Here we have used Tensorflow object detection API and mobilenet v2.
